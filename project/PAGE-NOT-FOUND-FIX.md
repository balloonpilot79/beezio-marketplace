# 🔧 "PAGE NOT FOUND" - COMPLETE FIX GUIDE

## 🎯 **THE REAL PROBLEM**
The password reset emails from Supabase are still pointing to the wrong URL because the **Supabase dashboard settings** haven't been updated to point to your local development server.

---

## ✅ **WHAT I'VE ALREADY FIXED IN YOUR CODE:**
1. **Updated AuthContext.tsx** - Password reset now uses correct localhost URL
2. **Created ResetPasswordPage.tsx** - Handles password reset callbacks
3. **Added route to App.tsx** - `/reset-password` route is working
4. **Added TestResetPage** - Debug page to see what URLs are being passed

---

## 🚨 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW:**

### **STEP 1: Fix Supabase Dashboard Settings**

1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Open your project**: `yemgssttxhkgrivuodbz`
3. **Navigate to**: Authentication > Settings
4. **Set Site URL to**: `http://localhost:5173`
5. **Add Redirect URLs**:
   - `http://localhost:5173/**`
   - `http://localhost:5173/reset-password`
6. **Save changes**

### **STEP 2: Test the Routes Are Working**
Visit these URLs directly in your browser to verify routing works:

- ✅ http://localhost:5173/reset-password
- ✅ http://localhost:5173/test-reset

If these show "page not found", there's a routing issue. If they load, the problem is just the Supabase configuration.

### **STEP 3: Clear Browser Cache**
After changing Supabase settings:
- Clear browser cookies and localStorage
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### **STEP 4: Test Password Reset Again**
1. Request password reset
2. Check email - link should now point to `localhost:5173`
3. Click link - should load reset page successfully

---

## 🧪 **DEBUG STEPS:**

### **Test 1: Check if routing works**
Go to: http://localhost:5173/test-reset
- ✅ If loads: Routing works, problem is Supabase config
- ❌ If 404: There's a routing issue in the app

### **Test 2: Check what URL the email contains**
Look at the password reset email:
- ❌ If contains `beezio.co`: Supabase settings not updated
- ✅ If contains `localhost:5173`: Settings updated correctly

### **Test 3: Manual test of reset page**
Go to: http://localhost:5173/reset-password?access_token=test&refresh_token=test&type=recovery
- ✅ Should load the reset password form
- ❌ If 404: Route not working

---

## 🔍 **MOST LIKELY CAUSE:**

**90% chance**: Supabase dashboard still has Site URL set to `https://beezio.co` instead of `http://localhost:5173`

**10% chance**: Browser cache is serving old redirect URLs

---

## 📞 **IMMEDIATE ACTION:**

1. **Right now**: Go to Supabase dashboard and change Site URL to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Save** the settings  
3. **Clear browser cache**
4. **Try password reset again**

This should fix the "page not found" error immediately.

---

## 🎉 **SUCCESS CHECK:**
After the fix, the password reset flow should be:
1. Click "Forgot Password" → Enter email → "Reset email sent"
2. Check email → Click link
3. Link goes to: `http://localhost:5173/reset-password?access_token=...`  
4. Reset password page loads successfully ✅
5. Enter new password → Success → Redirect to dashboard

The code is ready - you just need to update the Supabase dashboard settings!
