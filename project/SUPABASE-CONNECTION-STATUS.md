# SUPABASE CONNECTION STATUS

You're absolutely right - Supabase should be tied to the site but currently isn't fully connected.

## Current Status:
- ✅ All Supabase code is implemented and ready
- ✅ Database migrations are complete (6 migration files)
- ✅ Authentication system fully built
- ✅ All components use Supabase for data
- ❌ Missing actual Supabase project connection (.env file)

## To Connect Supabase:

### Option 1: Link Existing Project
If you already have a Supabase project:
```bash
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

### Option 2: Create New Project
If you need to create a new Supabase project:
```bash
supabase projects create beezio-marketplace
```

### Option 3: Use Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Create new project or access existing one
3. Get your project URL and anon key
4. Create .env file with these credentials

## What Happens Next:
Once connected, the site will have:
- Real user authentication
- Database-backed product catalog
- Order processing and payments
- Seller/affiliate dashboards with real data
- All advanced features working live

The infrastructure is 100% ready - just needs the connection credentials!
