# ✅ PLATFORM FEE CORRECTION COMPLETE

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Old Formula (Incorrect)**
- **Beezio got EQUAL SHARE** of (Seller + Affiliate + Stripe)
- For $50 seller + $10 affiliate = $60 + $1.80 Stripe = **$124.80 total**
- Beezio got **$62.40 (50% of total)** ❌

### **New Formula (Correct)**
- **Beezio gets 10%** of (Seller + Affiliate + Stripe)
- For $50 seller + $10 affiliate = $60 + $1.80 Stripe = **$68.64 total**
- Beezio gets **$6.24 (9.1% of total)** ✅

## 📊 **Updated Fee Structure**

### **Formula**: `Listing Price = (Seller + Affiliate + Stripe) + Beezio (10%)`

#### **Example: $50 Product, 20% Affiliate**
| Party | Amount | Calculation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Seller** | $50.00 | Exactly what they wanted |
| **Affiliate** | $10.00 | 20% of seller amount |
| **Stripe** | $1.81 | 3% of ($50 + $10) + $0.60 |
| **Beezio** | $6.18 | 10% of ($50 + $10 + $1.81) |
| **Customer** | $68.00 | Total paid |
