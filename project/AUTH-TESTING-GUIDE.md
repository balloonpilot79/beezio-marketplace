# 🧪 COMPREHENSIVE AUTHENTICATION TESTING GUIDE

## ✅ **WHAT I'VE FIXED:**

### **1. Fixed Authentication Flow:**

- ✅ Dashboard component already handles role-based rendering correctly
- ✅ Removed broken redirects to non-existent routes
- ✅ Simplified login/signup flow

### **2. Role-Based Dashboard System:**
- ✅ **Buyers** → `EnhancedBuyerDashboard`
- ✅ **Sellers** → `EnhancedSellerDashboard`  
- ✅ **Affiliates** → `EnhancedAffiliateDashboard`
- ✅ **Fundraisers** → `EnhancedAffiliateDashboard` (with modifications)
