## 🔄 How It Works

### Single Entry Point
```tsx
// Dashboard.tsx - NOW SIMPLIFIED!
return <UnifiedMegaDashboard />;
```

**No more role switching! Everyone gets the SAME dashboard with different tabs enabled based on their role.**

### Dynamic Tab Filtering
```tsx
const tabs = [
  { id: 'overview', label: 'Overview', icon: LayoutDashboard, show: true },
  { id: 'products', label: 'Products', icon: Package, show: canSellProducts },
  { id: 'orders', label: 'Orders', icon: ShoppingCart, show: canSellProducts || isBuyer },
  // ... only shows tabs the user has access to
].filter(tab => tab.show);
```

### Data Fetching
- **fetchProducts()**: Gets all products for sellers
- **fetchOrders()**: Gets orders for sellers/buyers
- **fetchCommissions()**: Gets commissions for affiliates
- **fetchStats()**: Calculates all stats (revenue, earnings, sales)

All data fetched in parallel using `Promise.all()` for fast loading!
