# 🔄 FEE STRUCTURE UPDATE - 15% PLATFORM + 5% REFERRAL

## 📋 **CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**

### **OLD Fee Structure:**
- Beezio Platform Fee: 10-15% (configurable)
- Referral Commission: 2-5% (variable)

### **NEW Fee Structure:**
- ✅ **Beezio Platform Fee: FIXED at 15%** (was 10%)
- ✅ **Referral Passive Income: FIXED at 5%** (was 2-3%)

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS MATTERS**

### **5% Referral Passive Income:**
Every affiliate who signs up using YOUR referral code earns you **5% of ALL their sales** - forever! This creates true passive income streams.

**Example:**
- You recruit 10 affiliates
- Each makes $10,000/month in sales
- Your passive income: $10,000 × 10 × 5% = **$5,000/month**
- You do NOTHING - just recruited them once!

### **15% Platform Fee:**
Increased from 10% to 15% to support:
- Better infrastructure and faster servers
- Enhanced seller/affiliate tools
- Marketing and growth initiatives
- Improved customer support

## 💰 **PAYOUT SYSTEM STATUS**

### **Already Built & Ready:**

#### **Referral Earnings Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE referral_earnings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  referral_id UUID REFERENCES affiliate_referrals(id),
  order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
  sale_amount DECIMAL(10,2),      -- Total sale
  referral_commission DECIMAL(10,2),  -- 5% calculated
  commission_rate DECIMAL(5,2),   -- Always 5.00
  status TEXT,                    -- 'pending', 'paid'
  paid_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### **Status Workflow:**
1. **Order completed** → `status = 'pending'`
2. **Admin approval** → `status = 'processing'`
3. **Payout sent** → `status = 'paid'`, `paid_at = NOW()`

#### **Admin Dashboard (TODO):**
