ðŸ§µ Thread: Why I switched to recurring commission affiliate programs

1/ Traditional affiliate marketing pays you once per sale
You make $100, customer pays monthly, you never see another penny

2/ Recurring commission programs pay you EVERY month
Same $100 commission becomes $1,800 over 18 months

3/ The math is incredible:
â€¢ 10 subscribers = $1,000/month recurring
â€¢ 50 subscribers = $5,000/month recurring  
â€¢ 100 subscribers = $10,000/month recurring

4/ This isn't just income - it's wealth building
Each new referral adds to your monthly total
Your income compounds and grows predictably

5/ Best part? Transparent pricing means customers trust you more
They see exactly where their money goes
Higher conversion rates = more subscribers for you

Hey [Name],

Quick question: Would you rather earn $100 once, or $100 every month for 18 months straight?

Obvious answer, right? Yet 95% of affiliates are stuck earning one-time commissions while leaving thousands on the table.

Here's what I mean:

**Traditional Affiliate Program:**
â€¢ Customer buys $150/month software
â€¢ You earn $50 commission... once
â€¢ Customer pays $2,700 over 18 months
â€¢ You earned $50 total (1.85% of customer value)

**Recurring Commission Program:**
â€¢ Same customer, same software
â€¢ You earn $50 EVERY MONTH they stay subscribed  
â€¢ Customer pays $2,700 over 18 months
â€¢ You earned $900 total (33% of customer value)

That's 1,800% more income from the SAME customer.

Tomorrow I'll show you exactly how top affiliates are building $50K+ monthly recurring income streams.

#### **Email 2: The Case Study**
**Subject: "How Sarah built $23,847/month recurring income"**

[Name],

Yesterday I told you about recurring commissions. Today, let me show you exactly how it works with a real case study.

**Meet Sarah - Beezio Top Affiliate**

Sarah promotes business software through Beezio's recurring commission program.

**Her Portfolio:**
â€¢ Product A: 127 subscribers Ã— $52/month = $6,604/month
â€¢ Product B: 89 subscribers Ã— $70/month = $6,230/month  
â€¢ Product C: 156 subscribers Ã— $31/month = $4,836/month
â€¢ Product D: 78 subscribers Ã— $79/month = $6,162/month

**Total Monthly Recurring Income: $23,847**

**Here's the kicker:**
Sarah built this over 8 months. Her income is predictable, grows monthly, and requires no additional work to maintain.

**What makes this possible?**
1. Subscription products people actually need
2. 25-50% recurring commission rates
3. 18+ month average customer lifetime
4. Transparent pricing builds trust = higher conversions
