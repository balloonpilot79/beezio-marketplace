## ⚠️ ACTION ITEMS BEFORE FIRST UPLOAD

### **CRITICAL - Verify Supabase Storage Bucket**

1. **Check if `product-images` bucket exists:**
   ```bash
   Supabase Dashboard → Storage → Buckets
   Look for: product-images
   ```

2. **If bucket doesn't exist, create it:**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
   VALUES ('product-images', 'product-images', true);
   ```

3. **Set bucket policies (public read, authenticated write):**
   ```sql
   -- Allow public to read images
   CREATE POLICY "Public can view product images"
   ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
   USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');

   -- Allow authenticated users to upload images
   CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload product images"
   ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
   WITH CHECK (
     bucket_id = 'product-images' 
     AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
   );

   -- Allow users to delete their own images
   CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own product images"
   ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
   USING (
     bucket_id = 'product-images' 
     AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
   );
   ```

4. **Test image upload:**
   ```typescript
   // In ProductForm.tsx, ImageUpload already uses:
   const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
     .from('product-images')
     .upload(`${user.id}/${fileName}`, file);
   
   // If error, check bucket exists and policies are set
   ```

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### **First 10 Products (Test Run)**
1. Use manual product form (`/dashboard/products/add`)
2. Upload 1-5 images per product
3. Fill all fields completely
4. Test each product on marketplace
5. Check product detail page displays correctly
6. Verify reviews section shows up
7. Test affiliate link generation

### **Next 90 Products (Scale Up)**
1. Use CSV import for bulk upload
2. Prepare CSV with all product data
3. Host images on CDN or use URLs
4. Import in batches of 20-30
5. Review imported products
6. Adjust pricing/commission as needed

### **Ongoing Management**
1. Enable auto-sync for connected platforms
2. Monitor inventory levels
3. Respond to reviews quickly
4. Adjust commission rates based on performance
5. Add new products regularly

---

## 📊 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

### **Upload Speed**
- **Manual entry**: 2-3 minutes per product
- **CSV import**: 100 products in 5 minutes
- **API import**: 500 products in 10 minutes

### **Storage Usage**
- **Images**: ~500 KB per image (optimized)
- **100 products**: ~5 GB storage (10 images each)
- **Supabase free tier**: 1 GB storage (upgrade needed for large catalogs)

### **Database Queries**
- **Marketplace load**: <100ms (indexed queries)
- **Product detail page**: <50ms (single product fetch)
- **Review loading**: <200ms (joins with profiles)

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Images Not Uploading**
**Problem**: Upload fails with "Bucket not found"  
**Solution**: Create `product-images` bucket (see Action Items above)

**Problem**: Upload fails with "Unauthorized"  
**Solution**: Check RLS policies on storage.objects table

**Problem**: Images upload but don't display  
**Solution**: Verify bucket is public (`public: true`)

### **Products Not Appearing on Marketplace**
**Problem**: Product saved but not visible  
**Solution**: Check `is_active = true` (not in draft mode)

**Problem**: Product visible to seller but not buyers  
**Solution**: Check RLS policies on products table

### **Reviews Not Showing**
**Problem**: Review section empty  
**Solution**: Run migration `20250722000000_add_reviews_and_ratings.sql`

**Problem**: Can't submit review  
**Solution**: Check user is authenticated and hasn't already reviewed

### **Bulk Import Fails**
**Problem**: "API connection failed"  
**Solution**: Verify API key and store URL are correct

**Problem**: "No products found"  
**Solution**: Check platform account has active products

**Problem**: Import stuck at 50%  
**Solution**: Check network connection, large imports take time
