## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR**

1. **Images Not Uploading**
   - Check file size (<5MB)
   - Check format (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
   - Check bucket permissions (already set)

2. **Product Not Appearing in Marketplace**
   - Refresh page (sometimes cached)
   - Check `is_active` = true in database
   - Verify no RLS policy blocking visibility

3. **Price Calculation Confusion**
   - Your price = what YOU receive
   - Platform adds fees on top for buyer
   - Example: You set $100 → Buyer pays $110 (with fees)

4. **Category Not Saving**
   - Make sure category_id matches database
   - Select from dropdown (don't type)

5. **Commission Rate Issues**
   - Must be 1-50%
   - Can be decimal (e.g., 12.5%)
   - Saved as percentage (not decimal: 10 = 10%)
