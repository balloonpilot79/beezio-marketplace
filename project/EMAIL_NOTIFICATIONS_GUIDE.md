## Usage Examples

### Using the Email Hook

```tsx
import { useEmailNotifications } from '../hooks/useEmailNotifications';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {
    sendOrderConfirmationEmail,
    sendCommissionEmail,
    sendSaleEmail,
    sendShippingEmail,
    loading,
    error
  } = useEmailNotifications();

  const handleOrderPlaced = async (orderData) => {
    const success = await sendOrderConfirmationEmail(
      userId,
      userEmail,
      {
        orderId: 'ORD-12345',
        items: [{ name: 'Product', price: 99.99 }],
        total: 99.99,
        deliveryDate: 'March 15, 2024',
        shippingAddress: '123 Main St',
        trackingUrl: `${window.location.origin}/track/ORD-12345`
      }
    );

    if (success) {
      console.log('Order confirmation email sent!');
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleOrderPlaced} disabled={loading}>
      {loading ? 'Sending...' : 'Place Order'}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Direct Service Usage

EMAIL_SERVICE_PROVIDER=sendgrid  # or mailgun, aws-ses, etc.
```

### Production Email Service Integration

Replace the placeholder in `emailService.ts`:

```tsx
// TODO: Integrate with actual email service
// Example: SendGrid integration
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const msg = {
  to: emailData.to,
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
  subject: emailData.subject,
  html: emailData.html,
};

await sgMail.send(msg);
```

## Testing

### Demo Component
Use the `EmailNotificationsDemo` component to test all email types:

```tsx
import EmailNotificationsDemo from '../components/EmailNotificationsDemo';

// Add to any page for testing
<EmailNotificationsDemo />
```

### Manual Testing
1. Sign up a new user â†’ Welcome email should be sent
2. Place an order â†’ Order confirmation and sale notification sent
3. Mark order as shipped â†’ Shipping notification sent
4. Commission earned â†’ Commission notification sent
