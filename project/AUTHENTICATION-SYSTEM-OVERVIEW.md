## 📝 **SIGNUP PROCESS:**

### **Step 1: User Chooses Account Type**
When signing up, users select from:
- 🛍️ **Buyer** - To shop and purchase products
- 🏪 **Seller** - To sell products and manage inventory  
- 💰 **Affiliate** - To promote products and earn commissions
- 🎗️ **Fundraiser** - To raise money for causes (uses affiliate dashboard)

### **Step 2: Profile Creation**
The system automatically creates a profile record with:
```javascript
{
  user_id: "unique-auth-id",
  email: "user@example.com", 
  full_name: "User's Name",
  role: "buyer" | "seller" | "affiliate" | "fundraiser",
  phone: "optional",
  location: "City, State",
  zip_code: "optional"
}
```

### **Step 3: Automatic Dashboard Assignment**
After signup/login, users are redirected to `/dashboard` which automatically shows:
- **Buyers** → `EnhancedBuyerDashboard`
- **Sellers** → `EnhancedSellerDashboard` 
- **Affiliates** → `EnhancedAffiliateDashboard`
