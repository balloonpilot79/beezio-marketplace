# Debug Checklist for Beezio Issues

## 1. Login Modal Not Closing ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status**: Fixed and deployed
**What was done**: 
- Added 100ms delay after successful login for auth context to update
- Added 50ms delay before navigation to ensure modal closes first
- Modal now closes, then navigates to dashboard

**Test**: 
1. Click "Sign In"
2. Enter credentials
3. Submit
4. Modal should close within 200ms
5. Dashboard should load immediately after

---

## 2. Dashboard Link from Dropdown ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
**Status**: Should be fixed with timeout (deployed)
**What was done**:
- Added 1-second maximum wait timeout
- Dashboard will load even if auth context is slow
- Extensive console logging added

**Test**:
1. Login successfully
2. Click user dropdown (top right)
3. Click "Dashboard"
4. Should load within 1 second max

**If still failing**:
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for logs starting with "Dashboard:"
- Share the console output

## 3. Image Upload Not Working üîç NEEDS TESTING

### Check #1: Supabase Storage Buckets
The buckets need to exist with proper permissions:
- `product-images`
- `user-avatars`
- `store-branding`

**To verify in Supabase**:
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to Storage
4. Check if all 3 buckets exist
5. Click each bucket ‚Üí Policies
6. Should have policies allowing authenticated users to:
   - INSERT (upload)
   - SELECT (read)

**Bucket Policy Example** (RLS):
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'product-images' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow anyone to view images
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');
```

### Check #2: Browser Console Errors
When you try to upload an image:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try uploading an image
4. Look for errors in red

**Common errors**:
- "Storage bucket not found" ‚Üí Bucket doesn't exist
- "Permission denied" ‚Üí RLS policy issue
- "File too large" ‚Üí Over 10MB limit
- "Invalid file type" ‚Üí Not jpeg/png/webp

### Check #3: Network Tab
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try uploading an image
4. Look for requests to Supabase storage
5. Check if they return 200 (success) or error codes

**What to look for**:
- POST request to `supabase.co/storage/v1/object/product-images`
- Status: 200 = success, 401 = auth issue, 403 = permission issue, 404 = bucket not found

### Check #4: File Validation
The upload component only allows:
- **Types**: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- **Size**: Max 10MB per file
- **Count**: Max 5 files at once

Try with a small (< 1MB) JPEG first.

## Testing Sequence

### Full Flow Test:
1. ‚úÖ Go to https://beezio.co
2. ‚úÖ Click "Sign In"
3. ‚úÖ Enter credentials and submit
4. ‚è≥ Verify modal closes
5. ‚è≥ Verify dashboard loads
6. üîç Click "My Products" or go to seller dashboard
7. üîç Click "Add Product"
8. üîç Try uploading an image
9. üîç Check if upload completes to 100%

## Console Logs to Watch For

### Successful Login Flow:
```
AuthModal: Attempting sign in...
AuthModal: Sign in result: {user: {...}, session: {...}}
AuthModal: Login successful, user: your@email.com
AuthModal: Closing modal and navigating
AuthModal: Navigating to dashboard
Dashboard render: {hasUser: true, userEmail: "your@email.com", ...}
Dashboard: Rendering UnifiedMegaDashboard for user: your@email.com
```

### Successful Image Upload:
```
Upload error: (none - if you see this with an error, that's the problem)
```

---

## Quick Fixes

### If Modal Still Won't Close:
The build might not have deployed yet. Wait 3-5 minutes after push, then hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`).

### If Dashboard Won't Load:
Open console and share the "Dashboard:" logs - this will show exactly what's happening.

### If Images Won't Upload:
1. Check Supabase console ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Check buckets exist
2. Check browser console for specific error messages
3. Try uploading from a different browser
4. Verify you're logged in (check top right for username)

---

## Next Steps

After testing, report back with:
1. ‚úÖ or ‚ùå for login modal closing
2. ‚úÖ or ‚ùå for dashboard loading from dropdown
3. ‚úÖ or ‚ùå for image upload
4. Any error messages from browser console (F12)

This will help pinpoint exactly what needs to be fixed!
