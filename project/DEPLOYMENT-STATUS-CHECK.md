## How to Check Deployment Status

### Option 1: Netlify Dashboard (Most Accurate)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Log in
3. Click "beezio-marketplace" site
4. Click "Deploys" tab
5. Look for commit `fb1126e` with message "Merge all dashboards into UnifiedMegaDashboard..."

**Status Indicators:**
- 🟡 **Yellow "Building"** = Still building (wait 1-2 more minutes)
- 🟢 **Green "Published"** = Deployed successfully! Ready to test!
- 🔴 **Red "Failed"** = Build failed (need to check logs)

### Option 2: Test the Live Site
**If it's been 5+ minutes since push:**

1. **Clear browser cache first!**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Check "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Open incognito/private window**
   - Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
   - Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + P`

3. **Navigate to beezio.co/dashboard**

4. **Login** (if not already logged in)

5. **What to look for:**
   - ✅ **NEW**: Beautiful gradient header (orange to purple)
   - ✅ **NEW**: Welcome message with your name
   - ✅ **NEW**: Tabbed navigation (Overview, Products, Orders, Earnings, etc.)
   - ✅ **NEW**: Stats cards with colored borders
   - ✅ **NEW**: "Store Settings" tab (not a separate page)
   - ✅ **NEW**: Custom Domain in Store Settings → Domain tab

## What Changed in This Deployment

### 🎯 Main Change: ONE Unified Dashboard
**Before:**
- Separate dashboards for sellers/affiliates/buyers
- Had to click around to find features
- Custom domain setup was confusing

**After (fb1126e):**
- ✨ **ONE dashboard for everyone**
- ✨ **All features in tabs** (Overview, Products, Orders, Earnings, Affiliate Tools, Store Settings, etc.)
- ✨ **Store Customization with Domain tab built right in**
- ✨ **Beautiful modern UI with gradients and stats cards**
- ✨ **Role-based feature access** (sellers see seller tools, affiliates see affiliate tools)

### 📁 Files Changed
1. **NEW**: `UnifiedMegaDashboard.tsx` - The new unified dashboard
2. **MODIFIED**: `Dashboard.tsx` - Now uses UnifiedMegaDashboard instead of role-based routing
3. **INCLUDED**: `StoreCustomization.tsx` - With Domain tab (CustomDomainManager)

## Is It Deployed? Quick Check

### ✅ YES if you see:
- Gradient header (orange/purple) on dashboard
- Tabbed navigation at top
- "Store Settings" as a tab (not in sidebar)
- Stats cards with colored left borders
- Your name in the welcome message

### ❌ NO if you see:
- Old dashboard layout
- Sidebar navigation only
- No tabs at the top
- Plain white header
- Generic "Dashboard" title

## Current Status (9:20 PM)

**Time elapsed since push**: ~5-10 minutes

**Expected status**: 
- Build: ✅ Likely complete
- Deploy: ✅ Likely complete
- CDN cache: ⏳ May still be clearing

**Recommendation**: 
1. Check Netlify dashboard now (should show green "Published")
2. If published, clear browser cache and test beezio.co/dashboard
3. If not published yet, wait 2-3 more minutes
