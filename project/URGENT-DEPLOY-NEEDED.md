# üö® URGENT: LIVE SITE PASSWORD RESET FIX

## üéØ **THE REAL PROBLEM**
Your site is live on **beezio.co** but the updated code with the `/reset-password` route hasn't been deployed to production yet. Users clicking password reset links get "page not found" because that route doesn't exist on the live site.

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT I'VE FIXED:**

1. **Updated AuthContext.tsx** - Now correctly detects production vs development
2. **Created ResetPasswordPage.tsx** - Production-ready reset password handling
3. **Added routes to App.tsx** - `/reset-password` route now exists
4. **Fixed environment detection** - Works for both beezio.co and localhost

---

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT NEEDED:**

### **Option 1: If using Netlify**
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
# Then drag the 'dist' folder to Netlify dashboard
# Or use Netlify CLI: netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### **Option 2: If using Vercel**
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### **Option 3: If using custom hosting**
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build
# Upload the 'dist' folder contents to your web server
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **SUPABASE SETTINGS CHECK:**

Make sure your Supabase dashboard has the correct URLs:

1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Project**: yemgssttxhkgrivuodbz
3. **Authentication > Settings**
4. **Site URL**: `https://beezio.co`
5. **Redirect URLs**:
   - `https://beezio.co/**`
   - `https://beezio.co/reset-password`
   - `https://beezio.co/dashboard`

---

## üß™ **TESTING AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

1. **Visit**: https://beezio.co/reset-password
   - ‚úÖ Should show reset password page (not 404)

2. **Test password reset flow**:
   - Request password reset
   - Check email - link should be: `https://beezio.co/reset-password?...`
   - Click link - should load successfully
   - Enter new password - should work

---

## üìã **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] Code changes deployed to beezio.co
- [ ] https://beezio.co/reset-password loads (not 404)
- [ ] Supabase Site URL set to https://beezio.co
- [ ] Supabase redirect URLs include beezio.co routes
- [ ] Password reset emails point to beezio.co
- [ ] Users can successfully reset passwords

---

## üî• **QUICK DEPLOY COMMANDS:**

If you're using Netlify and have the CLI:
```bash
cd "c:\Users\jason\OneDrive\Desktop\bz\project"
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

If you're using Git + automatic deployment:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add password reset page for production"
git push origin main
```

## ‚è∞ **THIS IS URGENT** because users are currently:
- ‚ùå Getting "page not found" when trying to reset passwords
- ‚ùå Unable to recover their accounts
- ‚ùå Having a broken user experience

**Deploy the updated code ASAP to fix the live site!**
