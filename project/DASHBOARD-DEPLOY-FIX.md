# 🚨 URGENT: Fix beezio.co Dashboard Display

## Current Problem:
- ✅ **Code is correct**: Dashboard.tsx routes to EnhancedSellerDashboard/EnhancedAffiliateDashboard
- ✅ **Routing is correct**: `/dashboard` → Dashboard component
- ❌ **beezio.co/dashboard** → Shows generic/old dashboard instead of full-featured dashboard

## Root Cause:
beezio.co is serving **STALE/CACHED content** or pointing to an old deployment.

   git add .
   git commit -m "Force deploy - clear cache on beezio.co" --allow-empty
