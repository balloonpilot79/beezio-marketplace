# üåê Fix beezio.co Domain Configuration

## üö® Current Problem

- ‚úÖ **beezio-marketplace.netlify.app** ‚Üí Shows CORRECT dashboard
- ‚ùå **beezio.co** ‚Üí Shows WRONG/outdated dashboard

This means beezio.co is either:
1. Pointing to the wrong Netlify site
2. Cached/propagating old content
3. Not configured in Netlify at all

---

## üéØ Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Check Netlify Domain Settings (5 minutes)

#### 1.1 Go to Your Netlify Dashboard
1. **Login** to Netlify: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Find your site**: Look for "beezio-marketplace" in the sites list
3. **Click on it**

#### 1.2 Check Domain Management
1. Click **"Domain management"** in the left sidebar (or under Site settings)
2. Look at the **"Custom domains"** section
3. Check if **beezio.co** is listed

**What you should see:**
```
Primary domain: beezio-marketplace.netlify.app

Custom domains:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beezio.co (should be here)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ www.beezio.co (optional)
```

---

### Step 2: Possible Scenarios & Fixes

#### Scenario A: beezio.co is NOT in the list
**Problem**: Domain not added to this site  
**Fix**:
1. Click **"Add custom domain"**
2. Enter: `beezio.co`
3. Click **"Verify"**
4. Netlify will check DNS
5. Click **"Add domain"**

#### Scenario B: beezio.co IS in the list
**Problem**: May be pointing to wrong site or DNS cache  
**Fix**:
1. Check if HTTPS/SSL is enabled (green lock icon)
2. If pending, wait for SSL provisioning
3. Clear your browser cache or test in incognito
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for CDN cache to clear

#### Scenario C: You have MULTIPLE Netlify sites
**Problem**: beezio.co might be on a different site  
**Fix**:
1. Go back to Netlify dashboard home
2. Check ALL your sites (look for any other beezio sites)
3. If you find beezio.co on another site:
   - Go to that site ‚Üí Domain management
   - **Remove** beezio.co from that site
   - Go back to beezio-marketplace site
   - Add beezio.co as custom domain

### Step 3: Verify DNS Records (At Your Domain Registrar)

#### 3.1 Where did you buy beezio.co?
Common registrars: GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare, etc.

#### 3.2 Login to your domain registrar
1. Find DNS settings (usually called "DNS Management" or "DNS Records")
2. Check the current records for beezio.co

#### 3.3 Required DNS Records
Your DNS should point to Netlify:

**Option A - A Record (Recommended):**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank for root)
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600 (or auto)
```

**Option B - CNAME (Alternative for www):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: beezio-marketplace.netlify.app
TTL: 3600 (or auto)
```

**For Apex Domain (beezio.co without www):**
Some registrars support ALIAS or ANAME records:
```
Type: ALIAS or ANAME
Name: @
Value: beezio-marketplace.netlify.app
```

#### 3.4 Common DNS Issues
- ‚ùå **Wrong IP**: Should be `75.2.60.5` (Netlify load balancer)
- ‚ùå **Points to old host**: Remove old A records
- ‚ùå **Multiple A records**: Should only have Netlify's IP
- ‚è≥ **DNS propagation**: Can take 5-48 hours

---

### Step 4: Force Clear Caches

#### 4.1 Clear Netlify Cache
In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** dropdown
3. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
4. Wait for deploy to complete (~2 minutes)

#### 4.2 Clear Browser Cache
```
Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
Safari: Cmd + Option + E

OR just use Incognito/Private window
```

#### 4.3 Clear DNS Cache (On Your Computer)

**Windows (cmd.exe):**
```cmd
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
```

---

### Step 5: Test Domain Configuration

#### 5.1 DNS Propagation Checker
Use online tool to check DNS globally:
- https://dnschecker.org
- Enter: `beezio.co`
- Check if it shows Netlify IP: `75.2.60.5`

#### 5.2 Direct Test
```
Open browser
Go to: https://beezio.co
Force refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

#### 5.3 What You Should See
Both URLs should show the SAME dashboard:
- https://beezio-marketplace.netlify.app/dashboard ‚úÖ
- https://beezio.co/dashboard ‚úÖ

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Domain already registered on Netlify"
**Cause**: Domain is on another Netlify account/site

- Remove from old site first
- Wait 5 minutes
- Add to beezio-marketplace

### Issue 2: SSL certificate pending for hours
**Cause**: DNS not pointing correctly  
**Fix**:
- Verify DNS A record = 75.2.60.5
- Wait for DNS propagation
- Can take up to 24 hours

### Issue 3: Shows old site even after changes
**Cause**: Browser/CDN cache  
**Fix**:
- Clear browser cache
- Clear Netlify cache (trigger deploy)
- Test in incognito
- Wait 10-15 minutes

### Issue 4: beezio.co redirects to netlify.app
