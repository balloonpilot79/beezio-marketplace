# Check Domain Configuration

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ beezio-marketplace.netlify.app/dashboard ‚Üí CORRECT (full dashboard)
- ‚ùå beezio.co/dashboard ‚Üí WRONG (old/simple dashboard)

## Problem:
beezio.co is pointing to a DIFFERENT Netlify site (old deployment)

## Solution Steps:

### Step 1: Find Which Netlify Site beezio.co Points To

1. **Login to Netlify**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Check ALL your sites** - look for any site that has beezio.co attached
3. You likely have TWO sites:
   - ‚úÖ `beezio-marketplace` (correct one)
   - ‚ùå Another site (old one) with beezio.co attached

### Step 2: Remove beezio.co from Old Site

1. Find the site that currently has beezio.co
2. Go to that site ‚Üí **Domain management**
3. Find `beezio.co` in the custom domains list
4. Click the **"..." menu** next to beezio.co
5. Click **"Remove domain"**
6. Confirm removal

### Step 3: Add beezio.co to Correct Site

1. Go to **beezio-marketplace** site
2. Click **Domain management**
3. Click **"Add custom domain"**
4. Enter: `beezio.co`
5. Click **"Verify"**
6. Click **"Add domain"**

### Step 4: Wait for Propagation

- DNS changes take 5-10 minutes
- SSL certificate provisioning: 5-15 minutes
- Full propagation: up to 24 hours

### Step 5: Test

After 10-15 minutes:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Open incognito window
3. Go to: https://beezio.co/dashboard
4. Should now show the CORRECT dashboard!

## Quick Check Commands

### Check current DNS:
```cmd
nslookup beezio.co
```

This will show which IP beezio.co points to.

### Expected Result:
If pointing to Netlify, should show IP like: `75.2.60.5`

## What to Look For in Netlify:

### In the WRONG site (old deployment):
```
Custom domains:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beezio.co ‚Üê REMOVE THIS
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ some-old-name.netlify.app
```

### In the RIGHT site (beezio-marketplace):
```
Custom domains:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beezio.co ‚Üê ADD THIS HERE
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ beezio-marketplace.netlify.app
```

## Alternative: If You Don't See Multiple Sites

If you only see ONE site (beezio-marketplace), then:

1. The issue might be **DNS caching**
2. Or beezio.co might be on a **different Netlify account**
3. Or pointing to a **different hosting provider**

### Check Your Domain Registrar:
1. Login to where you bought beezio.co
2. Check DNS records
3. Make sure it points to Netlify:
   - **A Record**: `75.2.60.5`
   - OR **CNAME**: `beezio-marketplace.netlify.app`

## Screenshots Needed

To help you fix this, please share:

1. **Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Screenshot of ALL your sites (the sites list)
   - Screenshot of beezio-marketplace ‚Üí Domain management

2. **Domain Registrar** (where you bought beezio.co):
   - Screenshot of DNS records for beezio.co

This will tell us exactly what's wrong!

## Expected Timeline:

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| Remove from old site | 1 minute |
| Add to new site | 2 minutes |
| DNS propagation | 5-15 minutes |
| SSL certificate | 10-30 minutes |
| Global CDN | 1-24 hours |

**Fastest fix**: 15-20 minutes  
**Full propagation**: Up to 24 hours

---

## Next Action:

**Go to Netlify Dashboard and count how many sites you have:**
- If you see 2+ sites ‚Üí One has beezio.co attached (wrong one)
- If you see 1 site ‚Üí Check if beezio.co is in its domains

Tell me what you see! üîç
