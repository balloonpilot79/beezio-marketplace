# 🎯 QUICK START: Referral System Setup

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

You now have a **complete referral system** where affiliates can enter referral codes during signup and earn 5% passive income!

---

## 🚀 STEP 1: RUN DATABASE MIGRATION (CRITICAL!)

**Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New Query**

Copy and paste the entire contents of:
```
project/add-referral-fields-to-profiles.sql
```

Click **"Run"**

This will:
- ✅ Add referral_code column to profiles
- ✅ Generate unique codes for existing affiliates
- ✅ Create affiliate_referrals table
- ✅ Create referral_commissions table
- ✅ Set up all indexes and policies

**Expected Output:**
```
Query executed successfully
```

---

## ✅ STEP 2: VERIFY IT WORKED

**In Supabase SQL Editor, run:**

```sql
-- Check that columns were added
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles'
AND column_name IN ('referral_code', 'referred_by', 'referral_code_used');

-- Check existing affiliates got referral codes
SELECT email, referral_code FROM profiles
WHERE primary_role = 'affiliate'
AND referral_code IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
referral_code
referred_by
referral_code_used

email                    | referral_code
-------------------------+---------------
john@example.com         | JOHNDO
sarah@example.com        | SARAHW
mike@example.com         | MIKEJO
```

If you see codes like this, **it worked!** ✅

## 💰 HOW THE 5% COMMISSION WORKS

**Example: You refer Sarah**

1. Sarah signs up with your code: **JOHN2024**
2. Sarah promotes a $100 product
3. Sarah makes a sale → $100 × 15% = $15 platform fee
4. **You earn:** $100 × 5% = **$5.00**
5. Beezio keeps: $100 × 10% = $10.00

**This happens on EVERY sale Sarah makes - forever!**

If Sarah makes:
- 10 sales/month × $5/sale = **$50/month passive income**
- 100 sales/month × $5/sale = **$500/month passive income**

If you refer 10 affiliates like Sarah:
- **$500 - $5,000/month in passive income!**

- ✅ Make sure you ran the SQL migration
- ✅ Log out and log back in
- ✅ Check: `SELECT referral_code FROM profiles WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_ID'`

### **"Referral code validation not working"**
- ✅ Code must be UPPERCASE (auto-converts)
- ✅ Code must belong to an affiliate/fundraiser
- ✅ Check spelling carefully

### **"Link goes to 404 page"**
- ✅ Make sure link format is: `/signup?ref=CODE`
- ✅ Not `/marketplace?ref=CODE`
- ✅ Dashboard should show correct link
