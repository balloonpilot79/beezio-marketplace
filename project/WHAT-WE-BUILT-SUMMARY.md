## 💰 How Money Flows

### Without Referral
```
Seller wants: $70.00
Product Affiliate (20%): $14.00
Stripe (3% + $0.60): $3.12
Beezio Platform (10%): $8.71
─────────────────────────────
Customer Pays: $95.83
```

### With Referral (NEW!)
```
Seller wants: $70.00
Product Affiliate (20%): $14.00
Referring Affiliate (2%): $1.92  ← NEW!
Stripe (3% + $0.60): $3.12
Beezio Platform (8%): $6.79     ← Reduced from 10%
─────────────────────────────
Customer Pays: $95.83           ← Same total!
```

**Key:** The 2% comes from YOUR platform fee, not the customer!

---

## 🎬 The Complete Flow

### Step 1: Affiliate A Joins
```
Affiliate A signs up
→ Auto-generated code: JOHN4X9Z
→ Gets referral link: beezio.co/signup?ref=JOHN4X9Z
```

### Step 2: Affiliate A Shares Link
```
Shares on social media, email, forums
→ "Join Beezio and start earning!"
```

### Step 3: Affiliate B Uses Link
```
Clicks link → beezio.co/signup?ref=JOHN4X9Z
→ Sees yellow banner: "john invited you!"
→ Signs up as affiliate
→ Database: Creates affiliate_referrals record
```

### Step 4: Affiliate B Makes Sales
```
B promotes products → Makes $100 sale
→ Order completion function runs
→ Checks: "Was B referred?"
→ Finds: Yes, by Affiliate A
→ Calculates: $100 × 2% = $2.00
→ Creates: referral_commissions record
→ Updates: affiliate_referrals totals
→ Reduces: Platform fee 10% → 8%
```

### Step 5: Affiliate A Earns
```
Opens dashboard
→ Sees: "Pending Earnings: $2.00"
→ Sees: "1 Referred Affiliate"
→ Sees: "$100 in sales generated"
```

### Step 6: Growth Loop
```
Affiliate B gets their own code
→ Shares with Affiliate C
→ C signs up under B
→ C makes sales → B earns 2%
→ A does NOT earn from C (only 2 tiers)
```

- A does NOT earn from C's sales ❌
- Prevents infinite chain commissions

### Security
- RLS policies protect all data
- Users can only see their own referrals
