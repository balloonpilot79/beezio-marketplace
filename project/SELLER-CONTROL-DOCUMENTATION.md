# SELLER CONTROL & FEE STRUCTURE DOCUMENTATION

## üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE: SELLER CONTROLS EVERYTHING

### **How It Works:**
1. **Seller sets their desired profit** for each product when adding it
2. **Seller chooses affiliate commission rate** for each product  
3. **All fees are added ON TOP** of seller's desired amount
4. **Seller gets 100%** of what they want - no deductions ever!

## üí∞ FEE STRUCTURE FORMULA

```
FINAL PRICE = Seller Amount + Platform Fee (10%) + Affiliate Commission + Stripe Fee (3%)
```

### **Example:**
- Seller wants: **$100.00**
- Seller chooses: **20% affiliate rate**
- Platform fee: **$10.00** (10% of $100)
- Affiliate commission: **$20.00** (20% of $100) 
- Stripe fee: **$3.90** (3% of $130)
- **Customer pays: $133.90**

### **Result:**
- ‚úÖ Seller gets exactly **$100.00** 
- ‚úÖ Affiliate gets **$20.00**
- ‚úÖ Platform gets **$10.00** 
- ‚úÖ Stripe gets **$3.90**

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **Product Creation (ProductForm.tsx)**
- Uses `PricingCalculator` component
- Seller inputs desired profit amount
- Seller chooses affiliate commission rate (% or flat rate)
- Real-time calculation shows final customer price
- Clear messaging: "This commission does NOT come out of your profit"

### **Database Schema**
- `products.seller_amount` = What seller wants to earn
- `products.commission_rate` = Seller's chosen affiliate rate
- `products.commission_type` = 'percentage' or 'flat_rate'
- `products.price` = Final customer price (calculated)
- `products.platform_fee` = 10% of seller amount
- `products.stripe_fee` = 3% of (seller + platform + affiliate)

### **Payment Processing**
- `paymentProcessor.ts` handles correct fee distribution
- Supabase functions distribute payments correctly
- Each party gets exactly what was calculated upfront
