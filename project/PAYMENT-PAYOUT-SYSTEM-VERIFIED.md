## üìä THE FORMULA (How Money Flows)

### **Listing Price Calculation:**
```
Listing Price = (Seller + Affiliate + Stripe) + Beezio
```

Where:
- **Seller Amount** = What seller wants to earn (their desired profit)
- **Affiliate Commission** = Seller's choice (% or flat rate) added on top
- **Stripe Fee** = 3% of (Seller + Affiliate) + $0.60
- **Beezio Platform Fee** = 10% of (Seller + Affiliate + Stripe)

### **Example: $100 Product, 20% Affiliate Commission**

```javascript
Seller wants:        $100.00
Affiliate (20%):     $ 20.00  (20% of $100)
Stripe (3%+$0.60):   $  4.20  (3% of $120 + $0.60)
Subtotal:            $124.20
Beezio (10%):        $ 12.42  (10% of $124.20)
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Customer Pays:       $136.62
```

### **Distribution After Sale:**
- ‚úÖ Seller receives: **$100.00** (exactly what they wanted!)
- ‚úÖ Affiliate receives: **$20.00** (their commission)
- ‚úÖ Beezio receives: **$12.42** (platform revenue)
- ‚úÖ Stripe receives: **$4.20** (payment processing)
- **Total**: $136.62 ‚úÖ Matches customer payment

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### **1. Pricing Calculation Layer**
**File:** `src/lib/pricing.ts`

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
calculatePricing(input: PricingInput): PricingBreakdown
- Calculates complete pricing breakdown
- Input: sellerDesiredAmount, affiliateRate, affiliateType
- Output: sellerAmount, affiliateAmount, platformFee, stripeFee, listingPrice

calculateSellerPayout(breakdown): number
- Returns exactly what seller requested
- No deductions, 100% accurate

calculateAffiliatePayout(breakdown): number
- Returns affiliate commission amount
- Based on seller's choice of rate

calculatePlatformRevenue(breakdown): number
- Returns Beezio's 10% platform fee
- Always 10% of (seller + affiliate + stripe)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **VERIFIED CORRECT**

---

### **2. Product Form (Seller Interface)**
**File:** `src/components/ProductForm.tsx`

**What Happens:**
1. Seller enters their desired profit amount
2. Seller chooses affiliate commission (optional)
3. System calculates exact listing price
4. Displays transparent breakdown showing all fees
5. Saves all amounts to database:
   - `price` = listing price (what customer pays)
   - `seller_amount` = seller's desired profit
   - `commission_rate` = affiliate commission %
   - `platform_fee` = Beezio's 10%
   - `stripe_fee` = payment processing fee

**Status:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED & WORKING**

---

### **3. Payment Processing**
**File:** `supabase/functions/create-payment-intent/index.ts`

**Process:**
1. Customer initiates checkout
2. System creates Stripe PaymentIntent for full amount
3. If seller has Stripe Connect account:
   - Direct charge to seller's account
   - Beezio takes 10% application fee
4. Order record created with payment status: "pending"

**Status:** ‚úÖ **WORKING**

---

### **4. Order Completion & Distribution**
**File:** `supabase/functions/complete-order-corrected/index.ts`

**Process:**
1. Payment confirmed by Stripe
2. System calculates exact distribution using formula
3. For EACH item in order:
   - Calculate seller's exact payout
   - Calculate affiliate's exact commission
   - Calculate Beezio's exact platform fee
   - Calculate Stripe's exact processing fee
4. Create payout records in `payment_distributions` table:
   - Seller payout (status: pending)
   - Affiliate payout (status: pending)
   - Platform revenue (recorded for accounting)
5. Update product sales counts
6. Create commission records for affiliates

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & CORRECT**

**Verification Log:**
```javascript
console.log('‚úÖ Order completed with NEW fee distribution:', {
  sellers: '$X (get exactly what they wanted)',
  affiliates: '$Y (commission)',
  platform: '$Z (10% platform fee)',
  stripe: '$W (3% processing)'
});
```

## üí∏ Payout Flow

### **Seller Payouts**

**Table:** `payment_distributions`
**Type:** `recipient_type = 'seller'`

**When:**
- Created immediately after successful payment
- Status starts as: `pending`

**Amount:**
- Exactly what seller requested in product form
- NO deductions, NO fees taken out
- 100% of their desired profit

**Example Record:**
```sql
{
  order_id: 'BZ-123456',
  recipient_type: 'seller',
  recipient_id: 'seller_uuid',
  amount: 100.00,
  percentage: 100.00,
  status: 'pending',
  created_at: '2025-10-13T...'
}
```

**Payout Process:**
1. Admin reviews pending payouts
2. Admin triggers payout via Stripe Connect
3. Money transferred to seller's bank account
4. Status updated to: `completed`
5. `stripe_transfer_id` recorded

---

### **Affiliate Payouts**

**Table:** `payment_distributions` AND `commissions`
**Type:** `recipient_type = 'affiliate'`

**When:**
- Created immediately after successful payment
- Linked to specific order and product
- Status starts as: `pending`

**Amount:**
- Based on commission rate set by seller
- Can be percentage or flat rate
- Added on top of seller's amount

**Example Records:**
```sql
-- Payment Distribution
{
  order_id: 'BZ-123456',
  recipient_type: 'affiliate',
  recipient_id: 'affiliate_uuid',
  amount: 20.00,
  percentage: 0,
  status: 'pending'
}

-- Commission Record
{
  affiliate_id: 'affiliate_uuid',
  product_id: 'product_uuid',
  order_id: 'BZ-123456',
  commission_rate: 20.00,
  commission_amount: 20.00,
  status: 'pending'
}
```

**Payout Process:**
1. Affiliates view earnings in dashboard
2. Request payout when threshold met ($50 minimum)
3. Admin approves and processes via Stripe
4. Status updated to: `completed`

---

### **Platform Revenue (Beezio)**

**Table:** `payment_distributions`
**Type:** `recipient_type = 'platform'`

**When:**
- Created immediately after successful payment
- Always 10% of (seller + affiliate + stripe)

**Amount:**
- 10% platform fee
- Used for:
  - Platform operations
  - Customer support
  - Infrastructure costs
  - Feature development

**Example Record:**
```sql
{
  order_id: 'BZ-123456',
  recipient_type: 'platform',
  recipient_id: null,
  amount: 12.42,
  percentage: 10.00,
  status: 'pending'
}
```

**Status:** Automatically collected via Stripe application fees

---

### **Stripe Processing Fees**

**Calculation:**
- 3% of (Seller Amount + Affiliate Commission) + $0.60

**Handling:**
- Automatically deducted by Stripe
- Included in customer's total payment
- No manual processing needed

**Example:**
- Seller: $100
- Affiliate: $20
- Stripe fee: (120 √ó 0.03) + 0.60 = $4.20
