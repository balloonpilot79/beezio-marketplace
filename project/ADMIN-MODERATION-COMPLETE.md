## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **Step 1: Deploy Database Migration**
```bash
# Option 1: Copy SQL to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy entire content from:
   supabase/migrations/20250116000000_content_moderation_system.sql
3. Click "Run"
4. Wait for success message: "✅ Content Moderation System created successfully!"

# Option 2: Use Supabase CLI (if installed)
supabase migration up
```

### **Step 2: Verify Database Tables**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN (
    'reported_content',
    'disputes',
    'dispute_messages',
    'user_moderation',
    'seller_verification',
    'moderation_log'
  );
```

You should see all 6 tables listed.

### **Step 3: Verify RLS Policies**
```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled:
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN (
    'reported_content',
    'disputes',
    'dispute_messages',
    'user_moderation',
    'seller_verification',
    'moderation_log'
  );
```

All should show `rowsecurity = true`.

### **Step 4: Test Components Locally**
```bash
# Make sure all components compile
npm run build

# Or start dev server
npm run dev
```

### **Step 5: Deploy to Production**
```bash
# If using Netlify
git add .
git commit -m "Add admin moderation panel with content reporting system"

## 📊 MONITORING & ANALYTICS

### **Dashboard Stats (Real-time):**

- When it happened (created_at)
- Why (reason field)

### **Query Sample:**
```sql
-- View moderation activity for last 7 days
SELECT 
  action_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  DATE(created_at) as day
FROM moderation_log
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY action_type, DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Tables not created**
```sql
-- Check if migration ran:
SELECT * FROM schema_migrations;

-- Manually create tables if needed:
-- Copy/paste the SQL migration file
```

### **Issue: Access denied to moderation**
```sql
-- Verify your user is admin:
SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- Update role if needed:
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

### **Issue: RLS blocking queries**
```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS for testing (DON'T DO IN PRODUCTION):
ALTER TABLE reported_content DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Re-enable after testing:
ALTER TABLE reported_content ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### **Issue: Component not rendering**
```bash
# Check console for errors
# Verify imports are correct
# Make sure user is logged in
# Check if profile.role === 'admin'
```
