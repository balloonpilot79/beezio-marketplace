## 🎁 REFERRAL PASSIVE INCOME SYSTEM

### **How It Works:**

1. **Affiliate A** signs up → Gets referral code `JOHN4X9Z`
2. **Affiliate A** shares code with friends/followers
3. **Affiliate B** signs up using `?ref=JOHN4X9Z`
4. **Affiliate B** makes sales promoting products
5. **Affiliate A** earns **5% on EVERY sale** Affiliate B makes
6. **This continues FOREVER** - true passive income!

### **Example Passive Income:**

**Month 1:**
- You refer 10 affiliates
- They collectively make $10,000 in sales
- **You earn: $500** (5% × $10,000)

**Month 6:**
- Your 10 affiliates keep selling
- They make $20,000 in sales
- **You earn: $1,000** (5% × $20,000)
- **Total so far: $3,500+** from referrals alone!
