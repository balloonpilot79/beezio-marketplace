## ⚙️ Backend Logic (COMPLETED)

### Order Completion Function Updated
**File:** `supabase/functions/complete-order-corrected/index.ts`

**New Referral Commission Logic:**
1. ✅ After creating affiliate commission, check if affiliate was referred
2. ✅ Query `affiliate_referrals` table for referrer
3. ✅ Calculate 2% commission from total sale amount
4. ✅ Create `referral_commissions` record
5. ✅ Update `affiliate_referrals` totals (sales + commission)
6. ✅ Reduce platform fee from 10% to 8%

**Commission Calculation:**
```typescript
Sale Amount: $100
Referral Commission: $100 × 0.02 = $2.00
Platform Fee Adjusted: 10% → 8% (2% goes to referrer)
```

**Example Console Output:**
```
💰 Referral commission for product_123:
  referrer: 456
  referred_affiliate: 789
  sale_amount: $100.00
  commission: $2.00 (2%)

📉 Platform fee adjusted: -$2.00 (2% goes to referrer)
```

## 💰 Commission Structure (FINAL)

### When NO Referral Involved
| Recipient | Formula | Example (Seller wants $70) |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------|
| Seller | Desired amount | $70.00 |
| Product Affiliate | 20% of seller | $14.00 |
| Stripe | 3% + $0.60 | $3.12 |
| **Beezio** | **10% of subtotal** | **$8.71** |
| **Customer Pays** | **Total** | **$95.83** |

### When Referral IS Involved
| Recipient | Formula | Example (Seller wants $70) |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------|
| Seller | Desired amount | $70.00 |
| Product Affiliate | 20% of seller | $14.00 |
| **Referring Affiliate** | **2% of sale** | **$1.92** |
| Stripe | 3% + $0.60 | $3.12 |
| **Beezio** | **8% of subtotal** | **$6.79** |
| **Customer Pays** | **Total** | **$95.83** |

**Key Point:** The 2% comes from Beezio's cut, reducing it from 10% to 8%

## 🚀 How It Works (Complete Flow)

### Step 1: Affiliate Gets Referral Code
```sql
-- Automatically created on signup or updated trigger
UPDATE users SET referral_code = 'JOHN4X9Z' WHERE id = 123;
```

### Step 2: Share Referral Link
```
https://beezio.co/signup?ref=JOHN4X9Z
```

### Step 3: New User Signs Up with Code
1. URL contains `?ref=JOHN4X9Z`
2. Frontend validates code exists
3. Shows yellow "You've been referred!" banner
4. On signup success:
   ```sql
   -- Update new user
   UPDATE users SET referred_by_code = 'JOHN4X9Z' WHERE id = 789;
   
   -- Create referral relationship
   INSERT INTO affiliate_referrals (referrer_id, referred_id, referral_code)
   VALUES (123, 789, 'JOHN4X9Z');
   ```

### Step 4: Referred Affiliate Makes a Sale
1. Product sold for $100 by affiliate #789
2. Order completion function runs
3. Checks: "Was affiliate #789 referred by anyone?"
4. Finds: Yes! Referred by affiliate #123
5. Calculates:
   ```typescript
   sale_amount = $100
   referral_commission = $100 × 0.02 = $2.00
   ```
6. Creates records:
   ```sql
   -- Create commission record
   INSERT INTO referral_commissions (
     referrer_id: 123,
     referred_affiliate_id: 789,
     order_id: order_uuid,
     sale_amount: 100.00,
     commission_amount: 2.00,
     status: 'pending'
   );
   
   -- Update running totals
   UPDATE affiliate_referrals
   SET total_sales = total_sales + 100.00,
       total_commission = total_commission + 2.00
   WHERE referrer_id = 123 AND referred_id = 789;
   ```

### Step 5: Referrer Sees Earnings
- Opens Referral Dashboard
- Sees: "Pending Earnings: $2.00"
- Views ReferredAffiliatesList
- Sees affiliate with "$100 in sales" and "$2.00 commission"
