The functions should start working properly. You can test by running:
node comprehensive-checkout-verification.js

Expected result:
✅ create-payment-intent function: WORKING
✅ complete-order-corrected function: WORKING  
✅ stripe-webhook function: WORKING
✅ process-marketplace-payment function: WORKING

🔥 ALTERNATIVE: Check if functions are actually deployed
=========================================================

You should see 4 functions listed:
- create-payment-intent
- complete-order-corrected  
- stripe-webhook

If they're not listed, you may need to redeploy them manually.
